            <p>Nowadays, the connections between cultures and cultures are more and more because of globalization. As people are brought closer, cultural differences appear. Culture is the quality in a person or society that arises from a concern for what is regarded as excellent in arts, letters, manners, scholarly pursuits. </p>

            <p>From different aspects, cultural differences have both advantages and disadvantages. Cultural differences have existed for centuries; however, these differences generate many problems because they cause difficulties for cross-culture immigrants, ruin relationship between people, and even cause bigger conflicts like wars.

            <p>Although difference can bring improvements to the cultures, cultural difference has more negative aspects than positive aspects. It can put cross-culture individuals into tight spots, reduce the efficiency of international groups and cause huge chaos like wars between different cultures. Throughout the presenting of the facts above, all of the three reasons that make cultural difference negative are proved. Overall, from my point of view, cultural difference is bad for our society. The solution is still unknown and waiting for further argument </p>
