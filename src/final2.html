                Cross-cultures immigrants play an important role in the new modern world. They glue cultures and cultures together; they make people know more about each other. However, for cross-culture immigrants, cultural differences can become a huge trouble. They influence them in a bad way especially when the immigrants first come to a new culture. For example, the time that cross-culture immigrants take to get adapt to the new culture is longer than immigrants moving to places that have same culture. “People move to another country need about three months to get used to the new environment; people move to another province only need about one month; and it is also easier for them to make new friends”(Dalian n.pag.).
            </p><p>The food, the clothes, the weather, the language and even the housings are different. The cross-culture immigrants need to learn everything about the new culture which is a really tough job to do. Not only the immigrants, visitors from another country also feel awkward when they come to a different culture. For tourism, cultural difference is a negative influence on international trips which has higher profits than local trips. And furthermore, if the cross-culture journey takes more than two weeks, it can even cause convert cultural shock when the visitors go back home, which makes the tours more complicated.
        </p>
            <p>On the other hand, cross-culture immigrants can give changes to the culture in a positive way. According to Liu Lijiun in his book “History of Our Country,” cross-culture immigrants in China appeared early. In Tang Dynasty, Master Jianzhen went to Japan to spread share chinese culture, modern Japanese culture is greatly influenced by Master Jianzhen theory. Every culture has its advantages and disadvantages. Immigrants can help  different cultures complement each other. It not only is a chance of improvement for people who are around the immigrants, but also can improve the immigrants’ personalities. We all would like to see the win-win situation.
            </p><p>“Culture makes people understand each other better. And if they understand each other better in their soul, it is easier to overcome the economic and political barriers.”  Paulo Coelho wrote this in his blog. “But first they have to understand that their neighbour is, in the end,  just like them, with the same problems, the same questions”(n.pag.). People are supposed to help each other to work things out. The merging of different cultures can possibility lead us human race to a whole better level.

            <p>There is no doubt that cross- culture immigrants can bring new colorful element to the surroundings; but more importantly, the harm that cultural difference does is countless.  For individuals, the difficulties due to the changing of environment and culture is called culture shock. Food, clothes and even languages, everything is different and can shock them easily. They have higher chance to lose their jobs than local employees and less close friends than people around them. So they are more likely to have living problems than normal residents. Therefore, some of them may have break downs with the mental and physical stresses.  The differences not only bring individuals sadness and loneliness, but also add unstable elements to the society. For the society, immigrants that have trouble with getting along with the culture can become a big problem. It is hard for people have hard times to react to things like everyone else. The possibility for them to become violator is way higher than others. “A rising crime rate is presented as the number of unstable immigrants increases from 1991 to 2004, we have to do something.”(</p>
