            <p>With the rapidly developing of new technologies like airplanes, telephones and  the Internet, it is easier for people from different places to communicate with each other. With all the easy communication, the interaction among people all around the world become faster and faster.  Therefore, more and more international organizations and companies appear all in a sudden  in recent years. There is no doubt that international groups have better chances than others, but cultural difference leads the international organizations and companies to another big problem.</p>
            <p> As we all know, communication is always the key to team works. But when multiple cultures are involved, communication becomes extremely hard. Not only the different languages, but also the different customs can be causing troubles. The website “Worldwide” provides us with many facts. For example, in an international company SNPC, during the first meeting of the managers from China and South Korea, a Korean manager bowed to a Chinese manager to show respect but the Chinese manager only felt awkward because bowing to others is not a part of Chinese culture. The result of the conference was a failure because of the embarrassment caused by cultural difference earlier.

            <p>Compared to local groups, international organizations and companies have bigger chances to gain successes. With the variety sources and large market, the developing space and opportunity for international companies and organizations are way bigger than national ones. Different cultures make different conditions in different countries. For example, the huge population in China makes labours cheap to hire while the new high technology in United States can reduce the cost. Therefore, an international company can produce same products cheaper with using the sources from different cultures wisely.</p>
            <p> Further more, marketing skill can also be improved by mix different cultures. People can sometimes find a better way of doing things after learning about another culture. The sharpness of the western world and the carefulness of the eastern world can combine together and create better methods. Better negotiation skills are also really important for businesses or the developing of organizations.

            <p>Although the combination of different cultures can definitely give the international group better opportunities to be succeed, it is really hard to work things out with the cultural differences. All the advantages of the international group can be ruined or even turn into disadvantages by cultural differences. Serious issues can be caused by that. According to Julianne Malveaux, the issues can even be world wide since the businesses normally have more than two cultures involved:</p><p>
            We have to examine the extent to which we export poverty to other societies. When we decide that we will import products from China that are produced by people earning less than a dollar an hour, and grant their country most-favored-nation status (political contributions notwithstanding), we are deciding to make American workers who must earn the minimum wage compete with them. I am not suggesting that we close the doors to China or to Mexico, but I am suggesting that we look very carefully at the web of international relationships that we are creating. At the very minimum, we should understand that we have two choices in our country: we can raise world living standards by exporting those standards, or we can lower living standards- not only the world’s but also our own- by deciding that it is acceptable for the products of exploited labor to enter this country.(n.pag.)
