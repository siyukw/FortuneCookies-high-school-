            <p>Cultural differences often lead to cultural conflicts. Conflicts are everywhere and they are normally erasable. But when cultural conflicts exist between two cultures and cannot be erased, physically conflicts get involved in, for example, wars. look through all the history of humans, only a few wars can benefit us more than drag us down. The most familiar example should be the civil war. The southern and the northern America had disagreement on civil rights. Therefore, the war started; thousands of people died. Nevertheless, wars can even make a culture disappear. When there is a conflict between two cultures, the weaker one normally gets hurt more and sometimes can even be taken over by the stronger one.</p>

            <p> Several decades ago, Chinese government held a vote for official language, mandarin beat conchinese. Nowadays, fewer and fewer people know how to speak comchinese. This kind of language is disappearing. All kinds of cultures are the arts made by life, it is a lose for all of us when a part of a culture is gone. Not even mentioning when a whole culture disappear.</p>

            <p>Cultural wars can refresh the society and  bring great improvements to the old culture. Cultural difference can break down a culture and the culture will become a new self. Culture must be shocked by something to improve itself; just like rules must be broken to rebuild. After World War II Japanese culture was shocked by the modern of the western world. After decades of efforts, Japan finally learned from other cultures and became one of the most powerful countries in the world with its unique culture.The cultural conflict after WWII helped Japan to mix its origin culture and western culture. <p>
            <p>Another more powerful example is China. During WWII, the eastern part of China was invaded by other countries. Therefore, foreign cultures only appeared in that part of China. But after WWII, the eastern China was developing faster and better than the western part of China. It was also cultural differences brought cultural conflicts, and that inspired eastern China to develop more rapidly to catch up with the rest of the world.

            <p>It is true that the wars caused by cultural difference have its own positive aspect, but the effect of the war is way worse than that. A candle does not light up the night; a drop of water does not wet the whole dessert. Wars that caused by cultural difference cannot be turned into positive things because their little advantages. Religions are also an important part of cultures. Religious wars never stopped since religions appeared in the world.

            <p>The conflicts over religions were surprisingly much more than others. There is an great example on an online  magazine called “Exchange Culture.” The Crusades was one of the most famous ones.  It was a huge war between the Catholic church and the Muslin. Although the Crusades fastened the developing of Europe, the cost was enormous. Tons of people died during the war; the conflicts between muslim and Christian were getting worse; the whole Europe experienced a long period of unstable time. Cultural difference bring people disasters by causing wars. Wars take away peace so that the world is messed up. Cultural wars also wash valuable things away in the format of wars from the world, for example, another culture.</p>
